Q30. different between circuit breaker and isolator
Ans. Circuit breaker is used to protect electrical circuits from damage caused by overload or short circuit, while isolator is used to isolate a circuit for maintenance or repair.
Circuit breaker is designed to automatically open and close the circuit in case of overload or short circuit.

Isolator is manually operated to disconnect a circuit for maintenance or repair.

Circuit breaker is a safety device, while isolator is a switching device.

Examples: MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker) is a type of circuit breaker, while a knife switch is a type of isolator.

Q33. What is transformer ?
Ans. A transformer is a device that transfers electrical energy between two or more circuits through electromagnetic induction.
Consists of two or more coils of insulated wire wrapped around a core

Primary coil receives electrical energy and induces a magnetic field in the core

Secondary coil receives the magnetic field and converts it back into electrical energy

Used to step up or step down voltage levels in power distribution systems

Q35. what is induaction motor?
Ans. An induction motor is a type of AC motor where power is supplied to the rotor by electromagnetic induction.
Induction motors are commonly used in various industrial applications due to their simplicity and reliability.

They do not require any brushes or commutators for operation.

The speed of an induction motor is determined by the frequency of the AC power supply and the number of poles in the motor.

Examples of induction motors include squirrel cage motors and wound rotor motors.

Q40. what is impedance
Ans. Impedance is the measure of opposition to the flow of alternating current in a circuit.
Impedance is a combination of resistance and reactance in a circuit.

It is measured in ohms (Ω).

Impedance can be calculated using the formula Z = √(R^2 + X^2), where R is resistance and X is reactance.

Impedance is important in determining the behavior of circuits in AC systems.

Examples of components with impedance include resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
