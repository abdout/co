# Slope Characteristic Testing for Differential Relays

## Overview

Slope characteristic testing is a critical procedure for differential relays to verify the relay's stability during through-fault conditions while maintaining sensitivity for internal faults. The slope (or percentage bias) characteristic defines how the relay's operating threshold increases with higher through-current to compensate for CT saturation and ratio errors.

## Required Equipment

- Multi-phase Relay Test Set with differential testing capability
- Test Leads and Connection Cables
- Differential Relay Setting Sheets
- Laptop with Relay Test Software (if applicable)
- Graphing Tools for Characteristic Plotting
- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- Test Record Forms

## Safety Precautions

> **WARNING**: Testing protection relays can cause inadvertent circuit breaker operations. Always follow isolation procedures to prevent unwanted tripping during testing.

1. Obtain necessary work permits and authorizations
2. Block relay trip outputs to circuit breakers or inform system operators
3. Isolate all sides of the protected equipment during testing
4. Use appropriate PPE
5. Verify test equipment is properly grounded

## Test Procedure

### 1. Preparation

1. Obtain and review:
   - Relay settings documentation, particularly slope settings
   - Manufacturer's instruction manual
   - Previous test results (if available)

2. Identify the slope characteristic parameters:
   - First slope (typically 25-40%)
   - Second slope (typically 50-100%), if dual-slope relay
   - Slope transition point (typically 2-5 times nominal)
   - Minimum pickup current

3. Prepare a test plan with test points:
   - At least 3 points on each slope segment
   - Points just above and below the operate threshold
   - Points just above and below the slope transition point

### 2. Connection

1. Isolate the relay from the CT circuits
2. Connect the test set to the relay:
   - Primary-side current inputs
   - Secondary-side current inputs
   - Binary inputs to relay trip contacts

3. Verify connections before applying test signals

### 3. Minimum Pickup Test

1. Configure the test set for minimum pickup determination:
   - Apply equal currents to all phases
   - In-phase on all windings
   - Gradually increase the difference between primary and secondary currents

2. Determine the minimum differential current required for relay operation
3. Verify this matches the relay settings

### 4. First Slope Region Test

1. Configure the test for points along the first slope:
   - Apply restraint current below the transition point
   - Apply differential current just below the expected operate threshold
   - Gradually increase differential current until relay operates
   - Record the exact operate point

2. Repeat the test for at least 3 different restraint current values in the first slope region:
   - Near minimum pickup
   - At mid-range (approximately 1.5 times nominal)
   - Near the slope transition point

3. Calculate the actual slope value from test results:
   ```
   Slope1 (%) = (Differential Current / Restraint Current) × 100%
   ```

### 5. Second Slope Region Test (if applicable)

1. Configure the test for points along the second slope:
   - Apply restraint current above the transition point
   - Apply differential current just below the expected operate threshold
   - Gradually increase differential current until relay operates
   - Record the exact operate point

2. Repeat the test for at least 3 different restraint current values in the second slope region:
   - Just above the transition point
   - At approximately 2 times the transition point
   - At a high current value (if safe for the relay)

3. Calculate the actual second slope value from test results:
   ```
   Slope2 (%) = (Differential Current / Restraint Current) × 100%
   ```

### 6. Slope Transition Point Test

1. Configure the test to verify the transition point:
   - Apply restraint current near the expected transition point
   - Apply differential current between the first and second slope thresholds
   - Gradually increase the restraint current
   - Record the restraint current at which the relay changes from operate to restrain

2. Verify the transition point matches the relay settings

### 7. Multi-Slope Graph Verification

1. Plot the test results on an XY graph:
   - X-axis: Restraint current
   - Y-axis: Differential current
   - Plot the expected characteristic from settings
   - Plot the measured operate points

2. Verify that the measured points align with the expected characteristic

## Acceptance Criteria

| Parameter | Acceptable Performance |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| Minimum Pickup | Within ±10% of setting |
| First Slope | Within ±5% of setting |
| Second Slope | Within ±5% of setting |
| Transition Point | Within ±10% of setting |
| Overall Characteristic | Measured points follow expected curve |

## Troubleshooting

If test results show discrepancies:

1. Verify that the relay settings match the test plan
2. Check test connections for proper polarity
3. For digital relays, verify parameter units (per unit, amperes, percent)
4. For electromechanical relays, check mechanical adjustments
5. Check for any additional biasing or restraint functions that might be active
6. Verify test current magnitudes are within the relay's operating range
7. For high-current tests, ensure adequate cooling time between tests
