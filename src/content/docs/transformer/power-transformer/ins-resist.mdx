# Insulation Resistance Testing for Power Transformers

Insulation resistance testing is a critical maintenance procedure for power transformers that helps identify insulation deterioration before it leads to equipment failure.

## Equipment Required

- Megohmmeter (Insulation Resistance Tester)
- Temperature measurement device 
- Safety equipment (rubber gloves, insulated tools)
- Test leads
- Cleaning materials

## Safety Precautions

1. **Isolate the transformer** - Ensure the transformer is completely de-energized and isolated from the power system
2. **Ground all terminals** before connecting test equipment
3. **Wear appropriate PPE** at all times
4. **Follow lockout/tagout procedures**
5. **Ensure proper grounding** of test equipment

## Test Procedure

### Preparation

1. Record ambient temperature and transformer temperature
2. Clean all bushings and terminals thoroughly
3. Disconnect all external connections to obtain accurate readings
4. Short-circuit windings not under test

### Measurement Sequence

Perform the following insulation resistance tests:

1. **High Voltage to Low Voltage & Ground**
   - Connect megohmmeter positive lead to HV winding
   - Connect negative lead to LV winding and ground
   - Apply test voltage for 1 minute and record reading

2. **Low Voltage to High Voltage & Ground**
   - Connect megohmmeter positive lead to LV winding
   - Connect negative lead to HV winding and ground
   - Apply test voltage for 1 minute and record reading

3. **High Voltage & Low Voltage to Ground**
   - Connect megohmmeter positive lead to both HV and LV windings
   - Connect negative lead to ground
   - Apply test voltage for 1 minute and record reading

### Test Voltage Guidelines

| Transformer Rating | Test Voltage |
|-------------------|--------------|
| < 1 kV            | 500V         |
| 1-2.5 kV          | 1000V        |
| > 2.5 kV          | 2500V        |

## Data Analysis

1. Calculate the Polarization Index (PI):
   - PI = R10/R1 (ratio of 10-minute to 1-minute readings)
   - Good insulation: PI > 2.0
   - Fair insulation: 1.5 < PI < 2.0
   - Poor insulation: 1.0 < PI < 1.5
   - Dangerous: PI < 1.0

2. Temperature Correction:
   - Apply temperature correction factor for insulation resistance
   - Standard reference temperature: 20Â°C

## Documentation

Record the following information:
- Date and time of test
- Transformer identification
- Test voltages used
- Test results (1-minute readings, 10-minute readings)
- Calculated PI values
- Temperature during testing
- Unusual observations
- Technician name
