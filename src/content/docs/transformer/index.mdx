## Overview

This section covers comprehensive information about transformer testing and commissioning. Power transformers are critical components of electrical power systems, used to transfer electrical energy between circuits through electromagnetic induction. Thorough testing is essential to ensure proper operation, reliability, and longevity of these assets.

## Precautions

- De-energize and properly ground the transformer before conducting tests
- Follow manufacturer's recommendations for handling and testing
- Use appropriate PPE including insulated gloves, safety glasses, and arc-flash protection
- Ensure proper ventilation when working with transformer oil
- Follow lockout/tagout procedures
- Verify that all test leads can handle the test voltages/currents
- Have fire suppression equipment readily available
- Consult relevant standards (IEEE C57, IEC 60076) for test procedures
- Document all test results and compare with factory test results

## Transformer Turns Ratio Test

### Test Procedure
This test measures the ratio of high voltage winding turns to low voltage winding turns to verify proper transformer construction and connection.

1. **Preparation:**
   - Review transformer nameplate data and connection diagram
   - De-energize transformer and isolate from the system
   - Disconnect all external connections including neutrals
   - Select appropriate TTR tester for the transformer voltage rating
   - Determine expected turn ratios for all tap positions

2. **Connection Setup:**
   - Connect TTR tester to one phase at a time
   - For three-phase transformers, test each phase individually
   - Connect H leads to high voltage terminals
   - Connect X leads to low voltage terminals
   - Ensure good electrical contact at all connection points

3. **Testing:**
   - Perform TTR test for each phase at nominal tap position
   - Record measured turn ratio and compare with nameplate
   - For tap changers, test at each tap position
   - Measure phase angle (optional, for vector group verification)
   - Calculate percentage deviation from expected values

2. **Connection Setup:**
   - Connect insulation resistance tester between:
     - HV winding to ground (LV and tertiary grounded)
     - LV winding to ground (HV and tertiary grounded)
     - Tertiary winding to ground (if applicable)
     - HV to LV (tertiary grounded)
