## Overview

This section covers comprehensive information about electrical component testing and commissioning. Components are the individual devices that make up electrical power systems, including circuit breakers, current transformers, voltage transformers, disconnectors, and other protection and control elements. Proper testing of these components ensures the reliability, safety, and performance of the overall electrical system.

## Precautions

- De-energize and lockout/tagout components before testing
- Follow manufacturer's recommendations for handling and testing
- Use appropriate PPE including insulated gloves, safety glasses, and arc-flash protection
- Ensure test equipment is properly rated for the application
- Verify proper isolation from energized parts before beginning work
- Use caution when working with charged components (capacitors, etc.)
- Ensure proper grounding of equipment and test instruments
- Follow relevant standards (IEEE, IEC, ANSI) for testing procedures
- Document all test results and compare with specifications

### Test Procedure
This test verifies the proper mechanical and electrical operation of circuit breakers, including contact resistance, insulation integrity, and trip timing.

1. **Preparation:**
   - Review breaker specifications and previous test records
   - De-energize breaker and rack out/isolate from service
   - Disconnect all external connections if necessary
   - Visually inspect for any physical damage or oil leaks
   - Document breaker details (manufacturer, type, rating, etc.)

2. **Connection Setup:**
   - Connect timing analyzer to breaker contacts
   - Connect micro-ohmmeter for contact resistance test
   - Connect insulation tester for insulation resistance test
   - For trip timing tests, connect to trip and close coils

3. **Testing:**
   - Measure contact resistance for each pole
   - Perform insulation resistance tests between phases and to ground
   - Measure trip and close coil resistance
   - Perform timing tests for open, close, and open-close operations
   - Test mechanical operations (manual and electrical)
   - Verify auxiliary contact operation
