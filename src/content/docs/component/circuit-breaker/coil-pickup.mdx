# Coil Pickup

## Overview

Circuit breaker coil pickup testing is a critical procedure to verify the minimum voltage at which a breaker's trip or close coils will operate. This test ensures that the coil will function reliably under various grid conditions, particularly during undervoltage situations.

## Required Equipment

- DC Variable Power Supply (0-250V DC)
- Digital Multimeter
- Test Leads
- Stopwatch/Timer
- Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
- Clipboard with Test Sheet

## Safety Precautions

> **WARNING**: Ensure the circuit breaker is isolated from all power sources before beginning the test. Follow lockout/tagout procedures as per site safety protocols.

1. Wear appropriate PPE including safety glasses and insulated gloves
2. Verify circuit breaker is in the open position
3. Ensure control circuit is de-energized and isolated
4. Inform all personnel in the area that testing is in progress

## Test Procedure

### 1. Preparation

1. Review circuit breaker manufacturer specifications for:
   - Rated coil voltage
   - Minimum pickup voltage (typically 70-85% of rated voltage)
   - Maximum dropout voltage (typically 30-60% of rated voltage)

2. Disconnect all external control circuits from the breaker
3. Connect the variable DC power supply to the trip/close coil terminals
4. Set multimeter to DC voltage range and connect in parallel with the coil

### 2. Trip Coil Pickup Test

1. Slowly increase the voltage from zero
2. Record the exact voltage at which the trip mechanism operates (pickup value)
3. Reduce the voltage to zero
4. Repeat the test three times to ensure consistency

### 3. Close Coil Pickup Test

1. Reset the breaker to the closed position (if applicable)
2. Connect the DC supply to the close coil circuit
3. Slowly increase the voltage from zero
4. Record the exact voltage at which the close mechanism operates
5. Reduce the voltage to zero
6. Repeat the test three times to ensure consistency

### 4. Dropout Voltage Test (Optional)

1. Apply rated voltage to the coil
2. Slowly reduce the voltage until the coil releases
3. Record this dropout voltage
4. Repeat three times for consistency

## Acceptance Criteria

| Parameter | Acceptable Range | Typical Values |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Trip Coil Pickup | 70-85% of rated voltage | 70-85V for 110V DC coil |
| Close Coil Pickup | 70-85% of rated voltage | 70-85V for 110V DC coil |
| Trip Coil Dropout | 30-60% of rated voltage | 30-60V for 110V DC coil |
| Close Coil Dropout | 30-60% of rated voltage | 30-60V for 110V DC coil |

## Troubleshooting

If the coil pickup or dropout voltages are outside acceptable ranges:

1. Check for mechanical binding in the trip or close mechanism
2. Examine coil for signs of overheating or damage
3. Measure coil resistance and compare to manufacturer specifications
4. Check plunger movement for smooth operation
5. Inspect auxiliary contacts for proper alignment
