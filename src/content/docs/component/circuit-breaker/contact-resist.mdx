# Contact Resistance Testing

## Overview

Contact resistance testing (also known as micro-ohm testing) is a critical maintenance procedure for circuit breakers to verify the integrity of the main contacts. High contact resistance can lead to excessive heating, reduced current carrying capacity, and potential equipment failure. This test measures the resistance across closed contacts using a specialized micro-ohmmeter.

The primary purposes of contact resistance testing are:
- Identifying deteriorated or damaged contacts before failure
- Detecting loose connections between main contacts
- Verifying proper contact alignment and pressure
- Establishing baseline values for future comparison
- Determining maintenance needs or replacement requirements

Contact resistance is affected by factors such as contact surface condition, contact pressure, alignment, and the presence of contaminants. Testing should be performed during commissioning, after maintenance, and as part of routine diagnostic testing.

## Precautions

> **WARNING**: Always isolate the circuit breaker completely from any power source before performing contact resistance tests. Verify isolation with appropriate testing devices.

- **Ensure complete isolation**: The circuit breaker must be fully disconnected from all potential power sources and verified dead
- **Lockout/Tagout**: Apply proper lockout/tagout procedures to prevent inadvertent energization
- **Discharge stored energy**: Release any stored mechanical energy in operating mechanisms and springs
- **High test currents**: Be aware that test equipment may produce currents up to 100A or higher
- **Equipment protection**: Avoid connecting to control circuits or auxiliary devices that could be damaged by test currents
- **Heat generation**: Prolonged testing can generate heat in connections - allow cooling between tests
- **Trip circuit isolation**: Ensure trip circuits are isolated to prevent unwanted operation
- **Follow manufacturer guidelines**: Adhere to specific test procedures for the breaker model being tested
- **Personal protective equipment**: Wear appropriate PPE including insulated gloves and safety glasses

## Test Procedure

### 1. Preparation

1. Review the manufacturer's specifications for:
   - Acceptable contact resistance values
   - Test current recommendations
   - Connection points for specific breaker model

2. Record ambient temperature (resistance readings should be temperature corrected)
3. Ensure all test leads and connection points are clean and free of oxidation
4. Verify test equipment calibration is current
5. Visually inspect circuit breaker contacts if accessible

### 2. Connection

1. Connect the micro-ohmmeter leads to the circuit breaker terminals:
   - Source side terminal (Line)
   - Load side terminal (Load)
   - Follow a consistent pattern for multi-pole breakers (test each pole separately)

2. Ensure connections are tight and secure with proper contact area
3. Use the four-wire (Kelvin) connection method for accurate measurements

### 3. Testing

1. Place the circuit breaker in the CLOSED position
2. Set the test current according to manufacturer's recommendations (typically 100A)
3. Initiate the test and record the resistance value for each pole
4. Release the test current
5. Repeat measurements at least twice to ensure consistency
6. Calculate the average value for each pole

### 4. Data Analysis

1. Compare results with manufacturer's specifications
2. Compare measurements between phases (should be balanced)
3. Compare with historical values if available
4. Calculate percentage deviation from baseline values

## Acceptance Criteria

### General Acceptance Values

| Circuit Breaker Type | Typical Acceptable Values | Maximum Deviation Between Poles |
| -------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Low Voltage (≤1kV) | 50-200 μΩ | ±10% |
| Medium Voltage (>1kV to 36kV) | 40-150 μΩ | ±10% |
| High Voltage (>36kV) | 30-100 μΩ | ±10% |

### Specific Criteria

1. The measured resistance must be below the maximum value specified by the manufacturer
2. Resistance values should be consistent across all phases (within the specified percentage)
3. Results should not exceed 120% of the baseline/commissioning value
4. No single phase should deviate more than 15% from the average of all three phases
5. Measurement stability: readings should be stable and repeatable

> **NOTE**: Always refer to manufacturer's specifications as acceptable values vary by breaker type, rating, and age.
