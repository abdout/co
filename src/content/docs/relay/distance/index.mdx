## Overview
This section covers comprehensive information about distance relay testing and commissioning. Distance protection is used to detect and isolate faults in transmission and distribution lines by measuring the impedance between the relay location and the fault. The relay operates when the measured impedance falls below a preset threshold, providing high-speed protection for power system lines.

## Precautions

- Ensure all testing personnel are qualified and familiar with the equipment
- Verify circuit isolation before commencing tests
- Use appropriate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
- Follow all safety protocols specific to the testing environment
- Double-check connections before applying test voltages/currents
- Ensure trip circuits are isolated to prevent unwanted operations
- Document all test results and relay settings for future reference
- Consult manufacturer's manual for specific safety requirements
- Pay special attention to CT and VT polarity connections as they are critical for directional elements

## Reach Test

### Test Procedure
This test verifies that the relay operates correctly for faults within the protected zone and remains stable for faults outside this zone.

1. **Preparation:**
   - Obtain relay settings from protection design documentation
   - Review the impedance characteristics (MHO, quadrilateral, etc.)
   - Calculate test points for each protection zone (Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3)
   - Configure test equipment with appropriate parameters
   - Isolate relay from power system (use test blocks where available)

2. **Connection Setup:**
   - Connect test set voltage outputs to relay voltage inputs
   - Connect test set current outputs to relay current inputs
   - Connect timing inputs to relay trip contacts
   - Verify all connections before applying test signals
   - Confirm auxiliary power supply to the relay

3. **Testing:**
   - Apply test points just inside and just outside each zone boundary
   - For each test point, apply pre-fault conditions, then transition to fault
   - Record the relay response time for in-zone faults
   - Verify that the relay does not operate for out-of-zone faults
   - Test multiple fault types (single phase-to-ground, phase-to-phase, three-phase)
   - Verify correct operation at different fault angles (0°, 45°, 90°, etc.)
