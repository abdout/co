# Overcurrent Relay Pickup Testing

## Test Procedure

Pickup testing is a critical procedure to verify the exact current value at which an overcurrent relay begins to operate. This test confirms that the relay will correctly detect fault currents and initiate protective actions, ensuring system reliability and equipment protection.

### 1. Preparation

1. Obtain and review:
   - Relay settings documentation and protection scheme drawings
   - Manufacturer's instruction manual
   - Previous test results (if available)
   - Current transformer (CT) ratios and connections

2. Record relay nameplate data and current settings
3. Calculate expected pickup values based on settings:
   - Primary pickup current = Tap setting × CT ratio
   - Secondary pickup current = Tap setting

### 2. Connection

1. Connect the test set to the relay:
   - Isolation: Disconnect the relay from the CTs (use test blocks where available)
   - Current injection: Connect test set current outputs to relay current inputs
   - Sensing: Connect timing inputs to relay trip contacts

2. Verify all connections before applying test currents
3. Set up the test set for manual current control or preset ramp function

### 3. Pickup Testing

#### Manual Method:
1. Start with current at 90% of the expected pickup value
2. Increase current slowly in small increments (1-2% steps)
3. Observe for relay pickup indication (LED, flag, or contact operation)
4. Record the exact current value at which pickup occurs
5. Reduce current to zero
6. Repeat the test 3 times to ensure consistency
7. Average the three readings

#### Ramp Method:
1. Configure the test set for current ramping:
   - Start current: 90% of expected pickup
   - End current: 110% of expected pickup
   - Ramp rate: 1% per second
2. Start the test and observe for relay operation
3. Record the pickup current
4. Repeat the test 3 times
5. Average the readings

### 4. Data Analysis

Calculate the pickup accuracy using the following formula:

```
Accuracy (%) = ((Measured Pickup - Expected Pickup) / Expected Pickup) × 100%
```

+----------------+     +---------------+     +----------------+
                                                    |
                                                    v
+----------------+     +---------------+     +----------------+
| Timer Start    |<----| Test Switches |<----| Relay Output   |
| (Test Set)     |     | (Test Block)  |     | Contacts       |
+----------------+     +---------------+     +----------------+
```

For three-phase testing, repeat the connection for each phase, ensuring proper phase rotation and reference.

## Acceptance Criteria

For overcurrent relay pickup testing, the measured pickup values should fall within the following tolerances:

| Relay Type | Acceptable Pickup Tolerance |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Electromechanical | ±10% |
| Static/Digital | ±7% |
| Numerical/Microprocessor | ±5% |

If the measured values fall outside these tolerances:
- Recheck your test connections and settings
- Verify the relay is functioning properly
- Consider recalibrating the relay if necessary
- Document any deviations and consult the protection engineer

## Tools Used

### Test Equipment
1. **Relay Test Set**: Modern microprocessor-based test equipment such as:
   - Omicron CMC356
   - Doble F6150
   - Megger SMRT410
   - ISA DRTS6

2. **Test Accessories**:
   - Relay test blocks (ABB FT-1, GE PK-2)
   - Test plugs compatible with installed test blocks
   - Shorting blocks for CT circuits

### Hand Tools
- Insulated screwdrivers set (flat and Phillips head)
- Insulated pliers and wire cutters
- Adjustable wrenches
- Multimeter (Fluke 87V or equivalent)

### Safety Equipment
- Insulated gloves (Class 0, up to 1000V)
- Safety glasses or face shield
- Arc flash protective clothing as required

## Appendix

### Precautions

> **WARNING**: Testing protection relays that are in service can cause inadvertent tripping and service interruption. Follow proper procedures to prevent unwanted operations.

- Obtain necessary work permits and authorizations before starting any testing
- If testing an in-service relay:
  - Block any trip outputs to circuit breakers
  - Notify system operators of testing activities
  - Disable auto-reclosing systems
  - Consider the impact on related protection schemes
- Use appropriate PPE including insulated gloves and eye protection
- Verify proper isolation of testing circuits from live power circuits
- Ensure test equipment is properly calibrated and rated for the application
- Do not exceed maximum current ratings of the relay under test
- Allow sufficient cooling time between repeated tests

### Troubleshooting Guide

If pickup test results are outside acceptable tolerances:

1. Verify relay settings match test plan
2. Check test connections for proper contact and polarity
3. Inspect relay for visible damage or signs of overheating
4. Check auxiliary power supply voltage to the relay
5. For electromechanical relays, check for:
   - Dirt or dust on moving parts
   - Binding of the disc or armature
   - Damaged bearings
