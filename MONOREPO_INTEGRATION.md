# Monorepo Integration Changes

## Issue Resolved: Double Path Problem (`/blocks/blocks/auth`)

We've fixed the issue with the double path and CSS not loading properly when accessing the Block app through our monorepo.

## Changes Made

1. **Reverted vercel.json to original configuration:**
   - Now using absolute URL rewrites to `https://block-ivory.vercel.app/:path*`
   - Added specific rewrites for all Next.js static assets
   - Removed relative rewrites that were causing issues

2. **Removed basePath configuration from Next.js:**
   - Removed `basePath` and `assetPrefix` from next.config.ts
   - This prevents the app from adding an additional `/blocks` prefix to paths

3. **Simplified middleware and auth config:**
   - Removed basePath handling from middleware.ts
   - Simplified route matching logic
   - Removed special redirect handling for basePath

## How It Works Now

1. When a user visits `cb.databayt.org/blocks/auth`:
   - The monorepo's vercel.json rewrites it to `block-ivory.vercel.app/auth`
   - The Block app serves content from its root path without adding another `/blocks` prefix
   - Static assets load correctly from `block-ivory.vercel.app/_next/...`

2. All navigation and links inside the app work normally:
   - When a user clicks a link like `/auth/login` in the Block app
   - The link stays within the `block-ivory.vercel.app` domain
   - The monorepo correctly maintains the `/blocks` prefix in the browser URL

This approach is cleaner because:
1. Only one system (the monorepo) manages path prefixing
2. The Block app functions normally at its own domain
3. No complex URL manipulation logic is needed in the Block app

## Environment Variables

For the Block app:
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=""` (empty string) in Vercel and any .env files

These changes should completely resolve the path issues experienced when accessing the Block app through the monorepo.
